# ArchPOWER-PKGBUILDs
This is a collection of PKGBUILDs and (where possible) precompiled binaries for ArchPOWER that are not available in base, testing or [ArchPOWER "extra"](https://github.com/techflashYT/archpower-extra-pkgs). Some packages can not be provided as binaries due to license restrictions.

At present, these are limited to 32-bit PowerPC (`powerpc`) which means they can be used on a G4, G5 with 32-bit userland and possibly G3/Wii. But the main focus will be on the G4/G5.

PKGBUILDs are sourced from the AUR and official Arch packages unless stated otherwise.
Feel free to submit PRs for fixes, updates, new packages and other improvements.
